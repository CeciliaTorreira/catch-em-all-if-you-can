First web game project.

Space Invaders inspired game with a Pokémon touch.

Repository created on 21/04/2023

21/04/2023: Created basic folders, documents and added some images to the repository. I'm still searching for better pictures to use in the project.
Added canvas, background, and Pokemon class. Next updates will probably be Pokémon movement and Pokéball class.

24/04/2023: Fixed player movement error. Changed background and player images. Adding the game over button to be used later when the game finished.
Checking and testing Pokéball speed, will try to make them randomly appear from every side of the canvas except bottom side.
