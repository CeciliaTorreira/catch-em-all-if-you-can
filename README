# Description

In this game you're a Bulbasaur trying to avoid getting caught.
Everytime you dodge or destroy a Pokéball you get points and your score goes up.
Be careful because the Pokéball speed will also increase.


# Main Functionalities

- The player can move using the four arrow keys.
- You can press the Space bar to attack. This action has a four seconds cooldown so use this wisely.
- Pokéballs will fall from the top of the canvas, if they hit you it's game over.
- Your only options are dodging or destroying them.
- The game difficulty increases as your score goes up, this means Pokéballs will be faster.
- You get 10 per Pokéball you dodge and 20 points if you destroy them.

# Backlog Functionalities

- I want to improve playuer's movement.
- Add the ability to move diagonally.
- Add enemy Pokémon with their own attacks.
